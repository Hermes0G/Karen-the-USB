**Karen's USB of Doom: The Ultimate Cybersecurity Prank**
============================================================

** Warning: Plugging in unknown USBs can be hazardous to your computer's health! **

**Why you shouldn't plug in unknown USBs:**

Imagine you're at a party, and someone offers you a mysterious taco. You don't know where it came from, but it looks delicious. You take a bite... and suddenly, your stomach is doing the cha cha slide.

Plugging in unknown USBs is like eating that mysterious taco. You don't know what kind of malware or viruses are lurking on that device, waiting to pounce on your computer. And trust us, you don't want to be stuck with a digital case of food poisoning.

**But fear not, dear user!** Karen's USB of Doom is here to educate you on the dangers of unknown USBs and motivate you to learn to code like a boss!

**How it works:**

1. Plug in the USB drive containing the `karen.bat` script.
2. The script will run automatically, displaying a humorous warning message about the dangers of unknown USBs.
3. The script will then open the GitHub page for this repository, providing users with a chance to learn more about cybersecurity and coding.
4. Finally, the script will Rickroll the user, because why not?

**The Code:**

The `karen.bat` script is a cleverly crafted batch file that uses ASCII art, humor, and a bit of sass to get its point across. The script is designed to be easily customizable, so feel free to modify it to fit your organization's style and branding.

**Autorun Installation:**

To make the prank even more convincing, we've included an `autorun.inf` file that sets the `karen.bat` script as the default autorun program. This means that when the USB drive is inserted, the script will run automatically, without the user needing to do anything.

**Impact Statement:**

By using Karen's USB of Doom, you'll not only learn about the dangers of unknown USBs, but you'll also be motivated to take control of your digital life. Learning to code is like having a superpower - you'll be able to create, innovate, and protect yourself from cyber threats. So, what are you waiting for?
